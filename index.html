		<h2>Why I Decided To Go</h2>
		<p>For as long as I can remember, I have had the need to travel. While school trips to Italy, France, and England were amazing opportunities in high school, living in a new country for an extended period of time would allow me to fully immerse myself in the culture and learn about a different country (as well as leave plenty of time for weekend excursions). I was very close to studying in Australia for the semester, but when I heard about all of the amazing opportunities that Denmark’s DIS program had to offer, I couldn’t turn it down. With an outdoor Living Learning Community, week-long study tours to different countries with my class, and connections to quality media and technology companies, I knew this was the right program for me.</p>

		<h2>How I Applied</h2>
		<p>After transferring into the School of Information at the end of my sophomore year, I was really hesitant to study abroad that winter because I didn’t want to fall behind in my course work. However, after talking with some of my advisors, I realized that the University of Michigan had a lot of resources to make sure I stayed on track, and they encouraged me to go. The program deadline was mid-October, and since they had a rolling admission setup, I was nervous that I wouldn’t get in. I finally was able to get all the necessary materials, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and application essays, submitted by the deadline (but just barely). Within two weeks, I had heard back that I got accepted into my second-choice program within DIS – though I realized soon after I got there that I could not have been placed in a better core course. Housing wasn’t assigned until later, but I applied to be placed in a Living Learning Community focused on outdoor adventures. Luckily, I was accepted into that program as well, and was assigned an apartment with the 20 other students in my LLC.</p>

		<h2>Looking Back</h2>
		<p>After almost a year back in the States, I still can’t believe that I almost didn’t study abroad. All of the amazing places I got to see and people I got to meet absolutely made up for the fact that I missed a semester in Michigan. I also feel like I satisfied my travel bug for a while – after leaving almost every weekend to live in hostels and backpack across countries, staying at home for a while sounds really nice. The classes I took also showed me a completely new side of technology and media and how they affect society, and in particular, politics. I would definitely recommend that anyone who is considering studying abroad to GO FOR IT.</p>
